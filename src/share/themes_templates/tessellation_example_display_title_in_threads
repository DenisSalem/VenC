With Tessellation you can tell VenC if it must display entry title or not.

By default, entry title are disabled.

On the user side, to display the entry title in blog thread, one have to set up the above metadata "__.:DisableMarkup::display_title_in_threads:.__".

By looking the source of the Tessellation theme, in _entry.html_ you'll see that we are calling the following patterns to achieve the trick.

.:Escape::
<pre>.:GetEntryMetadataIfExists::display_title_in_threads::&lt;h1&gt;.:GetEntryTitle:.&lt;/h1&gt;:.</pre>
::EndEscape:.
