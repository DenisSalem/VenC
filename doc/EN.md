# Presentation

VenC is a python application written for linux and similar to [Octopress](http://octopress.org)/[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to create and administrate your static blogs using the commandline. Using VenC, everything is text file, no database. Every blog's configuration is based on one unique and small Yaml file, themes consist in a handful of HTML templates to modify or to create yourself, on publications' side, they have one YAML part and one Markdown part.

Static blogs are fully adapted for darknets or for those who want a full control on their website without having to deal with heavy and potentially vulnerables CMS in security matter. Moreover, the extreme simplicity of the organisation of blogs' sources outcome from VenC guaranties a fast and efficient handling.

Also, here is what VenC has to offer:

- Creation of static blog (HTML/CSS).
- Simple page layout that you can directly personalize using HTML/CSS.
- Ability to create an arrangement in an arbitrary number of columns (as on my website).
- Infinite scrolling module simple and easy to setup (as on my website).
- Publications can be organised by categories and sub-categories.
- Publications can be organised by date periods.
- Up or down chronologic publicating.
- RSS feeds for every publications thread.
- Permalinks.
- Managing and editing the blog entirely via the commandline.
- VenC is conceived by GNU/Linux specifically.
- Publication's redaction in markdown.

# Installing

First of all, you should verify that python 3.x is installed. VenC also has dependances that we need to satisfy:

_For an easier installation, you may want to use pip. However, don't use pip as root, you may break your system._

__Python-Markdown__
You can take a peak at the [official page](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/index.html) or just type in _pip install markdown_ in a terminal.

__PyYaml__
You can take a peak at the [official page](http://pyyaml.org/) or just type in _pip install pyyaml_ in a terminal.

Having this done, clone the VenC repository

`git clone https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC`

Change directory to VenC's

`cd VenC`

Then start the installation script as root.

`./install.sh`

Voil√†, VenC should be correctly installed on your system.

# Uninstalling

In the not-so-likely-to-happen case where you'd like to uninstall VenC from your system type consecutively the following commands in a root terminal

`rm -rfv /usr/lib/python< yourversion >/VenC`

`rm -rfv /usr/share/VenC`

`rm -v /usr/bin/venc`

4. [Environmen Variables](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#environment-variables)

## File Tree

When you create a new project, VenC creates a certain amount of directories. The project's root takes the name of the blog, for example, "MooFooBar". This directory contains five others.

* __blog__: The folder where is exported the blog.
* __extra__: A folder containing whatever ressources copied to __blog/__ when exportating.
* __entries__: Contains every publication in the form of numbered and dated text files.
* __theme__: Contains html templates, stylesheets and optionally JS scripts.
* __templates__: Contains blank publication models.

2. [Templates](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#templates)
3. [Publications](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#publications)
4. [Themes](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#themes)

### Main config file

__blog_configuration.yaml__

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DenisSalem/VenC/master/doc/blog_configuration.png "")

It is a Yaml document in the project's root which defines blog's properties, such as it's title, it's author name, or functionnal details such as the number of by page publications or the printing order of those. Immediately after creating your blog, it will probably be the first file you'll edit. After fulfilling those fields (detailed below), you normally won't have to touch it again.


* __blog_name__ : Obviously your blog's name.
* __textEditor__ : Chosen text editor to edit your publications.
* __date_format__ : "%A %d. %B %Y" by default. Defines the date format used within the blog. The date format is in fact the one used by Python. Learn more on this format [here](http://strftime.org)
* __author_name__: Name of the administrator or author of the blog.
* __blog_description__ : A quick summary of what your site's about.
* __blog_keywords__ : Keywords associated to the website.
* __author_description__ : A short text about the author.
* __license__ : Your content's license.
* __url__ : Blog's URL. Can be left blank depending on the theme used.
* __blog_language__ : Blog's language.
* __email__ : Your e-mail address.
* __entries_per_pages__ : "10" by default. Obviously defines the per page publications number.
* __columns__ : "1" by default. This field defines the number of columns in a page.
* __rss_thread_lenght__ : "5" by default. Defines the number of publications to print in the RSS feed.
* __thread_order__ : "latest first" by default. Defines the order of publications. Oldest to newest, or the other way around. This field can be set to "oldest first", or "latest first".
* __path__ : A variable containing various paths, you normally shouldn't need to touch it. Those paths list is detailed below.
* __index_file_name__ : "index{page_number}.html" by default. Main thread of publications' fomratted filename. Should always contain the variable {page_number}.
* __category_directory_name__ : "{category}" by default. Defines the directory where will be exported a publication thread specific to a category of publication. This field should always contain the variable {category}.
* __dates_directory_name__ : "%Y-%m" by default. Defines the date format used for directories' names of publications threads associated to dates. The date format is in fact the one used by Python. Learn more on this format [here](http://strftime.org)
* __entry_file_name__ : "entry{entry_id}.html" by default. Defines the filename of a unique publication. This field should always contain the variable {entry_id}.
* __rss_file_name__ : "feed.xml" by default. Defines the rss feed's filename.

### Templates

A template actually is a blank publication which has been preformatted to contain information informations often used for which we don't want to lose time to rewrite or to shape. So a template file contains [patterns](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/FR.md#motifs-de-templates)
which can be called. There is no template by default, it up to the user to create theirs. When no template is used VenC creates a fully blank publication.

### Publications

A publication is a file similar to a template but which the purpose is to be filled by the user manually by redacting the desired content.
It can be a mood note, a documented article, an image galery, etc. To ease the edition of your blog with VenC you are strongly encouraged to use
templates.

A publication contains a firts part in [Yaml](http://yaml.org) format contening publication's metadatas, An another one in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format which will contain the said publication.

Finaly a blank publication looks like this:


![](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/newEntryFR.png?raw=true "")

SO we have four fields to complete, or not.

- __authors__ : It's the list of the publication's authors, separated by a coma. For example _Denis Salem, Aaron Swartz, Richard Stallman_.
- __categories__ : The list of the publication's categories, separated by a coma. You can also have sub-categories for a publication which will then define a categories tree. To define a sub-category one has to separate the parent category from the sub-category by ' > '. This can be repeated as many times as necessary. For example _Metal > Copper, Metal > Steel > Properties, Materials_.
- __entry_name__ : It's your publication's name as you defined it when creating the publication using `venc -ne <title of the publication>`.
- __tags__ : The list of the publication's keywords, separated by a coma. For example _Libre, Open-source, Linux_.

Both parts are separated by three dashes (the ones of the six). On the screenshot, the part containing the Markdown syntax is blank. So we are really talking about a blank publication.

Also, let's note that a publication's file name is formatted in a particular way.

`<id>__<month>-<day>-<year>-<hour>-<minute>__<title>`

To create a new publication it's [here](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#new-publication)

### Themes

A theme is the assembly of all fragments which will be joined together and interpreted by VenC to form your blog, it's in a theme that will be defined your website's page layout.
Typically, a theme is a directory containing at leat one folder, the __chunks__ folder and another, optional __assets__.

- __assets__ : Contains the necessary ressources for the page layout or the blog's operation. This can be images, CSS style sheets or JS scripts. You can also put there librairies like JQuery or bootstrap.

- __chunks__ : Must contain the following files
  - header.html
  - entry.html
  - footer.html
  - rssHeader.html
  - rssEntry.html
  - rssFooter.html

As you may have understood, VenC puts together the pieces of your blog by formatting the header (header.html) and by repeating a certain amount of times the operation which consists on formatting the piece which defines a publication (entry.html) for the current publication. The the current page is finished by adding the footer piece (footer.html) also formatted.

It's exactly the same principle for the RSS feed which is constructed identically.

It is not necessarily easy to create a theme from scratch and may want to avoid loosing too much time testing the fuctioning of all this. The best way to create a theme by yourself is to take a look at the [dummy](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/tree/master/src/share/themes/dummy) theme. THis theme, as is, is not usable, but it is a solid base to create yours. The CSS style is to define, and you may want to reorganize the elements in the page. If you have already installed VenC on your system you will find that theme in 

`/usr/share/VenC/themes/dummy`

Another approach is to look at how are constructed other themes. These ones will be added gradually on the github repository of VenC.

You can also help yourself with the [tips](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#tips) part in which are described various techniques to realise really specific page layouts and for which the usage may be a little bit obscure of VenC's patterns will be illustrated.

## Pattern Processor

1. [Template Patterns](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#template-patterns)
2. [Super Global Patterns](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#msuper-global-patterns)
3. [Publications Patterns](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#publications-patterns)
4. [Sp√©cial Patterns](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#sp√©cial-patterns)

VenC uses a pattern recognition engine allowing an easy and automated page layout setup. This system should allow in futur versions to use external modules. Plugin's creation and usage will be detailed in another part.

_Patterns which can be recognised are depending on the context in which they are found._

Patterns are defined like so in VenC

* Every pattern begins with '.:'
* Every pattern ends with ':.'
* The separator(s) within a pattern are represented with '::'

A pattern is a function which can take parametres. The objective is to replace a pattern by a formatted character string. Typically, patterns allow accessing to the blog's data or editing the page layout to do, say, a drop-down menu, or a navigation bar.

### Templates patterns

For more info on templates, it's [here](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#templates)
A template can contain a few patterns that VenC can interprete.

* __.:Get::EntryID:.__ : Returns the unique publication's ID.
* __.:Get::EntryName:.__ : Returns the publication's name.
* __.:Get::EntryMonth:.__ : Returns the month of the publication's creation.
* __.:Get::EntryYear:.__ : Returns the year of the publication's creation.
* __.:Get::EntryDay:.__ : Returns the day of the publication's creation.
* __.:Get::EntryHour:.__ : Returns the hour of the publication's creation.
* __.:Get::EntryMinute:.__ : Returns the minute of the publication's creation.

To those patterns, add the super globals which are generally available in any context.

### Super Global Patterns

Those patterns are generally available in any context and are defined in [blog_configuration.yaml](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#main-config-file).

* __.:Get::AuthorName:.__ : Returns the blog's author's name.
* __.:Get::BlogName:.__ : Returns the blog's title.
* __.:Get::BlogDescription:.__ : Returns the blog's description.
* __.:Get::BlogKeywords:.__ : Returns the blog's keywords.
* __.:Get::AuthorDescription:.__ : Returns the blog's author's description.
* __.:Get::License:.__ : Returns the blog's content's license.
* __.:Get::BlogUrl:.__ : Returns the blog's URL.
* __.:Get::BlogLanguage:.__ : Returns the blog's language.
* __.:Get::AuthorEmail:.__ : Returns the blog's author's email.
* __.:Get::RelativeOrigin:.__ : Returns the blog's root's relative path.

### Publications Patterns

A publication can contain the same patterns as the ones of a template. Also, add:

* __.:Get::EntryUrl:.__ : Returns the publication's permalinks.
* __.:Get::EntryContent:.__ : Returns the publication's body.
* __.:Get::EntryDate:.__ : Returns the formatted publication's date.
* __.:Get::EntryDateUrl:.__ : Returns the publication's date period's path.

### Special Patterns

It is possible in some cases to access some data iteratively, when these ones are as a list or as a tree

* __.:For:: liste :: bla bla {0[item]} bla :: separator :.__ : Allows iterating through a list. 
* __.:RecursiveFor:: arbre :: opening :: bla {0[item]} bla bla :: separator :: closing :.__ : Allows iterating through a tree, a particular type of list.

Note that in general the second parameter for the _For_ function actually is free text, to access the current iteration's item we use the context variable {0[item]}.
Ditto for the last parameter, the separator. The separator allows inserting some text after the current's iteration's free text.

Similarily, for the _RecursiveFor_ function, THe second, the fourth and fifth parameter are free text.

* __.:GetPreviousPage:: free text :.__ : When called in an exportation's thread, this pattern allows getting the previous page's URL, if it exists. To access the previous page's URL use the contextual variable __{0[destinationPageUrl]}__ whithin the free text.
* __.:GetNextPage:: free text :.__ : When called in an exportation's thread, this pattern allows getting the next page's URL, if it exists. To access the next page's URL use the contextual variable __{0[destinationPageUrl]}__ whithin the free text. 
* __.:PageList:: length :.__ : Allows getting a list of previous and next publications. The list's length is determined by __length__, which must be an integer.
* __.:IfInThread:: free text :.__ : Conditionnal pattern which allows printing the free or not text whether we are in a publication's thread or in a publication. This allows for example to have a particular page layout for a unique publication or for a publication's thread.

## Environment Variables

1. [blog_configuration.yaml](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#blog_configurationyaml)
2. [Pattern variables](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#pattern-variables)

### blog_configuration.yaml

Like in other VenC contexts. The blog's configuration file uses environment variables, the usage is detailed right below.

* __{page_number}__ : Defines the current page's number.
* __{category}__ : Defines the current publicating category.
* __{entry_id}__ : Defines the current publication's ID.

### Pattern variables

There also exist particular variables as lists. Those variables can be browsed iteratively and recursively to extract the content and to shape it. This extraction is done using special patterns _For_ and _RecursiveFor_. You can find out more on their functioning in the [Special Patterns](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#sp√©cial-patterns) part. But before, here are the available lists:

* __EntryTags__ : The current publication's keywords list. To access the current iteration's keyword use the contextual variable {0[tag]}.
* __EntryAuthors__ : the list of the current publication's authors. To access the current item use the contextual variable {0[author]}.
* __BlogDates__ : The list of th links to the publications grouped by date as defined in [blog_configuration.yaml](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#main-config-file). There are several available items for a current iteration: __{0[date]}__, __{0[dateUrl]}__. Respectively the period as formatted [blog_configuration.yaml](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#main-config-file) and the path to the directory associated to this period.

We now arrive in the particular case of categories. Categories form a tree as illustrated right below

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DenisSalem/VenC/master/doc/treesEN.png "")

Dwon below, we call "_leave_" the end of a branch, a so called "_complete branch_" is the complete path from the root of a tree to a leave of that tree.

* __EntryCategories__ : The category list (complete branch) of the current publication. Is found as nested lists. There are several available items for a current iteration: __{0[relativeOrigin]}__, __{0[categoryPath]}__ and __{0[item]}__. Respectively the current's page relative path to the blog's root, the current sub-category's relative path and the current sub-category's name.
* __EntryCategoriesTop__ : The list of the current publication's categories (leave). There are several available items for a current iteration: __{0[relativeOrigin]}__, __{0[categoryLeaf]}__ and __{0[categoryLeafUrl]}__. Respectively current page's relative path to the blog's root, the leave category's name and the URL towards the leave category.
* __BlogCategories__ : The list of the blog's categories (complete branches). Comes as nested lists. There are several available items for a current iteration: __{0[relativeOrigin]}__, __{0[categoryPath]}__ and __{0[item]}__. Respectively the current page's relative path to the blog's root, the current sub-category's relative path and the sub-category's name.

To use these patterns' special variables, go to the [Sp√©cial Patterns](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#sp√©cial-patterns) part.

# Commands

1. [Print VenC's version](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#print-vencs-version)
2. [New Blog](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#new-blog)
3. [New publication](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#new-publication)
4. [Exporting the blog](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#exporting-the-blog)

## Print VenC's version

`$ venc -v`

or

`$ venc --version`

## New Blog

`$ venc -nb <name of the blog>`

or

`$ venc --new-blog <name of the blog>`

VenC creates the directory containing the blog's sources in the place where you type in the command.

`$ venc -nb "mySuperBlog"`

`$ cd mySuperBlog`

`$ ls`

`blog  blog_configuration.yaml  entries  extra  templates  theme`

You cannot create a blog without giving it a name. Once you have created your blog, the first thing to do in general is to edit the file __blog_configuration.yaml__. For more info on this config file, it is [here](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#main-config-file).

## New publication

`$ venc -ne "<nom de la publication>" [nom du template]`

or

`$ venc --new-entry "<name of the publication>" [name of the template]`

To create a new publication, you __must__ be within the directory of your blog.

You cannot create a publication whithout giving it a title.

If you do not specify a template's name, VenC will make a publication totally blank. The template's name is in fact the filename of the desired template found in the __templates__ directory.

After this command VenC will try to open the new publication with the text editor specified in the main config file __blog_configuration.yaml__.

## Exporting the blog

`$ venc -xb`

or

`$ venc --export-blog`

To export your blog you __must__ be in your blog's directory.

There, is located a directory soberly titled blog. It is in this directory that your website will be exported. Once the exportation finished you can copy this directory's content on your server.

For more info on the file tree, it is [here](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#file-tree).

# Tips

To do

# Themes

1. [Installating](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#installating-1)
2. [Plugins](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#plugins)

## Installing

To install a theme on your blog, copy the directory __chunks__ and __assets__ (if this one exists) in the sub-directory __theme__ of your blog.

## Plugins

1. [Infinite Scrolling](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#infinite-scrolling)
2. [Clientside Search Engine](https://github.com/DenisSalem/VenC/blob/master/doc/EN.md#clientside-search-engine)

### Infinite Scrolling

It is an AJAX script which will automatically load the next pages' contents in the current page. This module is ideal for image galleries, for example. TO install this module, one just has to copy it

`VenC-Infinite-Scroll-<version>.js`

from

`/usr/share/VenC/themes/dummy/assets

in 

`<blog>/themes/assets`

Then add in __header.html__ 
    
`<script type="text/javascript" src=".:Get::RelativeOrigin:.VenC-Infinite-Scroll-<version>.js"></script>`

Voil√†, now the magic happens. But be careful. Check that the following are respected in your theme.

- The element containing your publication must have the class name "entry" or else the module won't be able to detect and get the publications of your blog.
- You can have a loading image anywhere in your page, but if you want to make it interact with the module it must have as ID name "__VENC_LOADING__".
- You can simply want to delete an element containing navigation links, for that the element will have to have as ID name "__VENC_NAVIGATION__".
